🔄 Procesing – C Process Management Examples
A collection of C programs demonstrating process creation, management, and inter-process communication (IPC) using POSIX standards.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains C source files that illustrate various process-related concepts:

Proces1.c: Demonstrates basic process creation using fork() and process identification with getpid() and getppid().​
proces.c: Explores inter-process communication mechanisms such as pipes for data transfer between parent and child processes.​
🛠️ Technologies Used
C Programming Language: Core language for system-level programming.​
POSIX API: Standard for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
🌟 Key Learnings
Process Creation and Management: Understanding how to create and manage processes using fork().​
Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Implementing pipes to facilitate communication between processes.​
Process Identification: Utilizing process IDs to track and control process execution.​
